## TourPlanner

# What is the problem you are addressing?

Planning a tour is a cumbersome task for those who are not interested in traveling with travel company. As it involves 
1)	Searching the tourist spots worthy to be visited and/or searching hidden gems and also to see if the tourist spot is open on the day of visit or not.
2)	Making the plan for transportation and routs to follow.
3)	Making the plan for stay and food.
 All this has to be done while keeping the time and expenses in mind so the trip back home occurs as planned without delay or missed flights or trains. 


# What is your proposed solution for this problem?
The proposed solution involves developing an app to get the planning done. This app will support tourism in Rajasthan and also other locations around the world. Thus   
The app would take the following input.
1)	Starting location of tour.
2)	Ending location of tour.
3)	Days of stay 
4)	Type of locations the user is interested in like for e.g. popular or hidden gems or less crowded, etc. 
5)	Particular locations user wants to visit for sure.
6)	Time of sleeping.
The output would be a completely detailed tour with following outputs.
1)	The location which will be visited in the plan made by the app.
2)	The date and time of visits along with the images of the location.
3)	The route to the location from the earlier location.
4)	The traveling method used like bus, train, car, etc.
5)	If the traveling involves pre-booking of tickets then it will also suggest the websites for doing so.
6)	The GPS coordinates of the user mobile will be monitored to make instant suggestions in case of random delays. The suggestion can be to skip a location to remain on schedule etc.
